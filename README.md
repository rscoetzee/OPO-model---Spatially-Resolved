# OPO-model---Spatially-Resolved

Extension of previous model. Includes Diffraction effects as well as walk off in model. Model is able to simulate more complex
beam structure than a simple plane wave, such as Gaussian fields. Model is solved using the split-step fourier algorithm in conjunction
with the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm.
